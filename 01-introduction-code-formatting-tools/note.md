#### Meaning of Clean Code ####

> There are no sole or strict definition of clean code.

* There exists no way to formally measure clean code, hence we are unable to run tools on the repository to tell us how good, bad or maintainable the code is.
* Although we can leverage on tools such as `checkers`, `linters`, `static analyzers` etc., is not sufficient.
* Clean code is **NOT** something machine or scripts can recognize but rather something that we, as professionals, can determine.
* The nature of clean code lies on other engineers, being able to read and maintain the code.

#### Importance of Clean Code ####

> Revolves around the idea of maintainability, reducing technical debt, working effectively with agile development, and managing successful project.

In terms of Agile Development and Continuous Delivery,

* Having good and maintainable code base is a must to ensure successful delivery of features constantly and steadily.
* If code base is not *clean*, whenever product management ask for new features, there will be a constant need to stop to refactor and fix any technical debt.
* *Technical debts*, refers to the concept of problems in a software as a result of a compromise or a bad decision being made.
* You can think about technical debts in two different ways:
    * What problems has been faced constantly and are they are a result of previously written bad code?
    * If you as a developer were to take a shortcut now, instead of investing time in developing proper solution, what kind of problems will you face in the future?
* Such scenarios are best to be avoided. Whenever it is possible, using automated tools to catch such scenarios are always worthwhile investments.
* The rest depends on good, thorough *code review*, and good *automated testing*. 
* Software are only useful to the degree of which it can be easily changed. 
* This meant that having a clean code base is an **ABSOLUTE** requirement for it to be maintainable and modified, hence further cementing the importance of clean code.
